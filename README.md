## To be implemented 

Skipgram Model in pytorch 
POS tagging in pytorch 
NER in pytorch

Design intents and entities for the NLP model 

- Get dataset of conversations for customer service or build a basic one with few phrases and synonyms
- Better to use Sigmoid or Tanh as activation functions 

General structure: Embeddings layer, RNN, Output dense layer for classification to predict the probability
of the next word given an input word. 

A better solution for chatbots: seq2seq modelling (RNN encoder and RNN decoder) with attention mechanism
